# Project Euler

Project Euler is a collection of problems tightly related to maths intended to be solved computationally. What I have in this repository are my attemps at solving those problems. Although I give some thought to the solutions I end up using/trying, I can't guarantee any of them are as efficient as they could be.

## Prerequisites

To run the programs you should only need Python 3. If this ends up changing I'll update this section.
